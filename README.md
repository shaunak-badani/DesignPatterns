# Design Patterns

This project is a culmination of the design patterns gathered from the Linked In courses by Bethan Palmer : 

* Behavioral Patterns : [I](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/java-design-patterns-behavioral-part-2/improve-code-quality-with-behavioral-design-patterns) & [II](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/java-design-patterns-behavioral-part-1/improve-code-quality-with-behavioral-design-patterns)
* [Structural Patterns](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/java-design-patterns-structural/what-is-a-design-pattern)
* [Creational Patterns](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/java-design-patterns-creational/improve-code-with-creational-design-patterns)


### Running the individual patterns

#### Java

In most pattern snippets, use
```
javac *.java
java <MainFile>
```

For some snippets, the command for compilation is listed in the pattern README.

#### CPP

```
g++ *.cpp
./a.out
```
